# Kafka Spark Streaming Example

An example project that shows how to use Spark Streaming 2.0.0 with Kafka as input and the Confluent Schema Registry using a specific Avro record (not the generic record).

This was tested against Kafka 0.10.0.0.

This is the _spark-2_ branch. The _master_ branch contains a version that is using Spark 1.6.2.
